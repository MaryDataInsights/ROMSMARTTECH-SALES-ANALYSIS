Recommendations

Customer ID 1215 generated a total revenue of $14,724.18 from 18 items, split evenly between smartwatches and smartphones. Since their purchases were made only in September and December, there’s an opportunity to increase their activity throughout the year. Targeted promotions or loyalty programs during off-peak months may help spread their purchases more evenly. Their preferred payment method is PayPal, so maintaining this option and possibly offering small incentives for PayPal users could further encourage transactions.
Customer ID 1234 spent a total of $12,672.45 exclusively on smartwatches, buying 15 units across May and September. This focused buying behavior suggests they have a strong preference for that product type. Cross-selling strategies such as recommending accessories or related products like smartphones could help expand their basket size. Because their purchases peak in specific months, timely reminders or special smartwatch promotions in similar months could enhance repeat buying behavior.
Customer ID 1182 also purchased only smartwatches, spending $11,867.85 on 15 units. This customer chose a debit card as their payment method and preferred overnight shipping for the majority of their purchases. Their buying pattern reflects a value on speed and simplicity. Offering them early access to new smartwatch models or providing occasional free overnight shipping may improve retention and satisfaction. Maintaining smooth debit card transactions and highlighting security or speed of this method could further reinforce their loyalty.
Customer ID 1244 bought 25 items, consisting of 15 tablets and 10 smartphones, resulting in a revenue of $11,617.35. This customer’s activity spans February, July, and December, with the highest revenue seen in February. Their use of both standard and overnight shipping suggests flexibility. Bulk-buy discounts or seasonal bundle offers could appeal to their purchasing style. Encouraging purchases in lower-activity months through targeted campaigns might help smooth their buying cycle.
Looking at the overall sales trend, January began strong with $49,327.33 in revenue but declined in February to $43,441.81. March then saw a sharp increase, reaching $91,537.51, the highest of the year. May, on the other hand, recorded the lowest revenue at $41,492.69. Analyzing what drove March’s spike—whether it was successful marketing, new product releases, or strategic pricing—could help replicate that success. May’s low performance indicates a need for proactive strategies such as discounts, product launches, or customer engagement activities to stimulate sales during that period.
Smartphones lead in terms of quantity sold, reaching 721 units, followed by tablets and smartwatches, while laptops had the lowest quantity sold at 269 units. This suggests smartphones are the most in-demand product, and their popularity could be leveraged through focused marketing, product bundles, or loyalty rewards. On the other hand, laptops may benefit from better positioning, limited-time offers, or highlighting features that differentiate them from other devices to boost interest and sales.
Credit card usage ranks highest as the preferred payment method, with 29% of customers using it, followed closely by debit cards and PayPal. Only 18% of customers prefer to pay with cash, indicating a clear trend toward digital and card-based payments. Enhancing the user experience for card and PayPal users, such as secure checkout and faster processing, could further increase satisfaction. For cash users, limited-time offers or discounts on digital payments might help convert them to more efficient channels.
Smartphones also dominate revenue generation, with $313,121.03 earned, followed by smartwatches with the same revenue value, and then laptops and tablets. Since smartphones and smartwatches contribute significantly to revenue, they should remain central to product promotions and new releases. However, laptops and tablets might require bundled deals, educational campaigns, or feature spotlights to improve their sales performance.
Overnight shipping is the most utilized shipping method with 658 items shipped, followed by standard shipping at 512 and express at 474, making express shipping the least used. This trend shows a strong customer preference for faster deliveries. Companies can consider offering free or discounted overnight shipping after a certain spending threshold to maintain this preference. At the same time, reassessing the value and pricing of express shipping could help improve its usage or phase it out if it's not cost-effective.
